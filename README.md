This project takes [piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped) and makes it easy to run. Click on the binary to run. That's it! So portable and easy to use, even your grandmother could do it.

## Config
On the first run, a config will be generated in the same folder as the executable. Alter it to your liking. For more options, please see [config.rs](src/config.rs)

## Building

You need node and `pnpm` installed first (and in your PATH). You also need [Rust installed](https://rustup.rs/) as well as java installed (and on the PATH)
- Run `cargo build --release`
